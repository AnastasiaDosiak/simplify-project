# Simplify Frontend Exercise

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). Styled using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Run the project

```bash
npm i
npm run build
npm run dev

# or

yarn
yarn build
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

| Script       | Description                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `dev`        | Runs the app in the development mode.                              |
| `start`      | Runs next start which starts a Next.js production server.          |
| `build`      | Runs next build which builds the application for production usage. |
| `prettier`   | Format your code with Prettier                                     |
| `lint`       | Run ESLint to catch errors.                                        |
